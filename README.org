#+TITLE: voicenotes2org

[[./formatted-output.png]]

=voicenotes2org= is a Python script which collects WAV files in a given directory, sends them to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for transcription, and then formats the resulting transcripts into a combined org file, including links back to the original audio.

Each note becomes a heading in the org file, and includes:
1. The date and time of the note
2. An org-link of type =voicenote=, which, when followed, plays the original audio file in EMMS
3. Google's transcript of the note, broken down into 10-second segments. Each segment begins with a =voicenote= link which will play the original audio file /at the time offset which corresponds to that segment/.

* Prerequisites

This uses Google's Cloud Speech-to-Text API, and *you will need your own GCP account*. Make sure you have a service account JSON.

Other than that, you'll need =python3= and =ffmpeg= on your system. Only tested on Arch Linux.

* Installation

It's on PyPI.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pip install voicenotes2org
#+END_SRC

* Basic Usage

Transcription jobs can be defined on the command line, or in a config file.

CLI Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
> voicenotes2org --voice_notes_dir=~/new-voice-notes/ --archive_dir=~/org/archived-voice-notes/ --org_transcript_file=~/org/unfiled-voice-notes.org
#+END_SRC

...or...

Config File:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
> cat ~/.config/voicenotes2org/default.toml
voice_notes_dir="~/new-voice-notes/"
archive_dir="~/org/archived-voice-notes/"
org_transcript_file="~/org/unfiled-voice-notes.org"

> voicenotes2org
#+END_SRC

Note that, in the config file, all relative paths will be interpreted as relative to the config file. For example, "filename_regex.txt" in =~/.config/voicenotes2org/default.toml= will be treated as =~/.config/voicenotes2org/filename_regex.txt=.

In both case, the script will find every WAV file in =~/new-voice-notes/=, and transcribe them. After transcription, they will be moved to =~/org/archived-voice-notes/=. If =~/org/unfiled-voice-notes.org= does not exist, it will be created with an eval header statement which defines the =voicenote= link type. If the file already exists, voicenotes2org will only append content, leaving existing content unmodified. There will be one new heading for each WAV file transcribed.

* WAV file naming rules

Unless you define your own regex file, WAV files must be named according to the following pattern:

    .* YYYY-MM-DD H-MM AM|PM .*.wav

Where:
- =YYYY= is the year.
- =MM= is zero-padded month.
- =DD= is zero-padded day.
- =H= is unpadded (sorry) hour in 12-hour format.
- =MM= is zero-padded minute.
- =AM|PM= is literally just "AM" or "PM".
- Everything is whitespace delimited.

* ðŸš¨ Limitations ðŸš¨

Many corners have been cut in the making of this script. If literally anyone else ever uses this code, these issues might be worth fixing some day.

** Only WAV files are supported

Wouldn't be hard to figure out the file format, but Google's transcription API requires non-WAV formats specify things like sample rate and encoding. I did not need this.

** Ugliness caused by avoiding Google Cloud Storage

Google caps the duration of audio which has been inlined into the transcription request at 1 minute. Anything longer than that, and you need to configure a Google Cloud Storage bucket. I didn't want to, so I split each voice note into 55-second chunks with a 5-second overlap.

For example, a 3 minute long voice note is actually transcribed in 4 separate chunks:
1. 0:00 to 0:55 -- 55 seconds
2. 0:50 to 1:45 -- 55 seconds, first 5 overlap
3. 1:40 to 2:35 -- 55 seconds, first 5 overlap
4. 2:30 to 3:00 -- 30 seconds, first 5 overlap

To reduce (or, maybe produce) confusion, I insert the sequence "//" into the transcription wherever we're about to start inserting overlapped content. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC
and we went to the store for some // the store for some candy to bring with us
#+END_SRC

This is ugly and lazy and later versions might improve this.

* Example Workflow

This is how I integrate my voice recordings into org-mode.

*Convenient Voice Recording*

I record voice notes on my Android device using "Easy Voice Recorder". I use this app specifically because it provides a system shortcut to toggle recording. The first invocation of this shortcut begins recording, and the second stops recording, saving the audio to a new WAV file. A third invocation would start recording again, but with another new file.

This app also lets you specify how audio files should be named, which makes it easy to encode date and time.

Most importantly, I use the "Button Mapper" app to *bind a long-press of the volume-up key to this shortcut*. This works even when the screen is off.

With this setup, ideas, tasks, and notes can be recorded instantly and effortlessly. Just long hold the volume up key, say whatever needs to be said, and long hold again to complete the file. No unlocking the phone, and no interacting with the touchscreen.

Alternatively, If you don't mind carrying a second device, a dedicated voice recorder would work at least as well.

*Syncing The Audio Files*

I use Syncthing to sync the voice notes directory on my Android device to a directory on my PC. This is probably the easiest way to achieve near realtime syncing, and Syncthing is FOSS!

Alternatively, you can manually copy the files every evening over USB, or SSH, or Google Drive, or...well, you get the idea.

*Transcription*

In my org directory structure, I have a file dedicated to receiving transcribed, but not yet properly filed, voice notes. Let's say that this is at =~/org/unfiled-voice-notes.org=. Let's also assume that my untranscribed voice notes are synced -- by Syncthing -- to =~/new-voice-notes/=.

If I run the example command under the =Basic Usage= heading, then absent any errors, =~/new-voice-notes/= will be cleared out. This frees up space on the phone, though otherwise isn't all that important. What is important is that, for each processed audio file, a new heading will appended to =~/org/unfiled-voice-notes.org=. The audio file will now live in =~/org/archived-voice-notes/=, and any file links in the org entries will point to this location. Because the links are absolute, the headings can be moved around wherever you'd like and will not break.

*Filing*

Once =voicenotes2org= has returned, you should open =~/org/unfiled-voice-notes.org= in Emacs, then use =org-refile= to pop each entry into a more proper location in your org directory structure. Make sure you've configured =org-refile-targets= first!
